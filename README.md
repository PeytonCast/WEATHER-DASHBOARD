# WEATHER-DASHBOARD
This is a weather dashboard web application. 
Enter a city to get the current weather in that city at well as a 5-day forecast! 
If you want to check another city's weather don't worry that's not a problem the dashboard will save your search and you can simply click on any city in the search history and it will pull up that city's weather again.
